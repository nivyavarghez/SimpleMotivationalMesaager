# Mood Message App 💬

This is a simple React-based messaging app built as part of my **Day 1 React learning journey**. The goal of this app is to understand the basics of React, including components, JSX, and project structure.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This app is a starting point for learning **React.js**. It’s my very first step into frontend development using a component-based approach. More features and refinements will be added as I move through each day of my React learning.

---

## 🚀 Features

- React-based UI setup using `create-react-app`
- Clean project structure
- Sample mood message component (to be added)
- Ready for future styling and logic improvements

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- Tooling: `npm`, `create-react-app`, Git
